  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I’m a wannabe rock guitar prodigy morphed into a designer + developer aspiring to help build a better web using the latest + greatest tools + techniques of a modern day front-end developer. The internet has become an invaluable tool that has exponentially changed the possibility of doing just about anything. I want to be a part of pushing the boundaries on what is possible, but never forgetting one key point... performance. Because after all, no one uses a slow website! :)</p>
  <p>When I’m not pecking away on the keyboard, I’m probably shredding guitar like a mad man, doing something outside like canoeing, hanging out with the "fam" or some sort of combination of all the above.</p>
  <p>Take a look at some of my work and let me know what you think. You can reach me on social media or shoot me a quick email at djbell70@gmail.com (no I didn’t used to be a DJ, it’s just my initials). Have a good one!</p>
