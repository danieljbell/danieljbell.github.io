    <h6>About Me</h6>
    <p>Hey There! I’m Daniel, a wannabe rock guitar prodigy morphed into a designer + developer aspiring to help build a better web using the latest + greatest tools + techniques of a modern day front-end developer.  The internet has become an invaluable tool that has exponentially changed the possibility of doing just about anything.  I want to be a part of pushing the boundaries on what is possible, but never forgetting one key point... <strong>performance</strong>. Because after all, no one uses a slow website! :)</p>
    <p>When I’m not pecking away on the keyboard, I’m probably shredding guitar like a mad man, doing something outside like canoeing, hanging out with the "fam" or some sort of combination of all the above.</p>
    <p>Take a look at some of my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/">work</a> and let me know what you think. You can reach me on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contact/">social media</a> or shoot me a quick email at <a href="mailto:djbell70@gmail.com">djbell70@gmail.com</a> (no I didn’t used to be a DJ, it’s just my initials). Have a good one!</p>
