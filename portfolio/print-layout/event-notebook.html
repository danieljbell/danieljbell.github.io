  <h5>Responsibility:</h5>
  <p>Along with all of the digital projects I currently get to work on, I've been heavily involved in the creating of printed marketing materials for each Bank Director event. With Event Notebooks being one of the more demanding pieces of print, I've had the chance to take this project + put my own stamp on it. The progress that has been made since taking over the project to now has been recognized by people internally + externally.</p>
  <p>The sample below is a digital representation of the printed notebook I most recently assembled + designed for one of Bank Director's events.</p>
