  <h5>Responsibility:</h5>
  <p>Riding alongside sales collateral emails, I've had the opportunity to create specific pieces tailored to the needs and wants of the sales department to assist in their work on getting a sale. This particular piece I've put together was more exciting than most as I was able to reach outside of the typical Bank Director look and create something that was very inline with the brand, but a different look all together. I used the polygon textures, icons and long shadows help to keep this piece a bit more trendy, but used a lot of the Bank Director look including fonts, colors + spacing used throughout the document.</p>
