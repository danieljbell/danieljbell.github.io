  <h5>Responsibility:</h5>
  <p>A free online resource, BankDirector.com, complements Bank Director's publications and conferences by sharing valuable content on strategic and governance issues, executive and director compensation, audit committees, risk management, technology trends, insurance and legal issues and other critical topics facing today's directors and officers.</p>
  <p>As a Front-End Designer, I've have the opportunity to work on many new projects to improve the look and usability of the site.  I've been a key player in adding new sections to the site as well as adding new functionality including reimagined event agenda and sponsor pages, adding a reader polling feature + an automatically updating grid of videos just to name a few.</p>
