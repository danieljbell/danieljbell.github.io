  <h5>Responsibility:</h5>
  <p>This project allowed me to really explore my creative side and learn a lot along the way as it relates to design. Typically, I'll recieve direction from the President and Vice President of Marketing on the different subjects and slides that will be needed and then I'll create several slide decks to be used throughout an event adhering to brand standards and pushing my own abilities.</p>
  <p>These decks can range from providing simple instructions related to the conference to a tailored animation sequence outlining the overall product offering of Bank Director.</p>
  <p>I've been a part of several complete redesigns in my time at Bank Director, which play a vitale role in the tone of the conference.</p>
