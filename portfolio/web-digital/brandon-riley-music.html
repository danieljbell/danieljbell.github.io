  <h5>Responsibility:</h5>
  <p>This is a webpage I built for a friend of mine.  It’s a fairly straight-forward webpage with a few features to keep things interesting.  I built a parallaxing effect on the header section of the page along with a sticky naviagation that locks to the top of the window when scrolling down to allow users to quickly and easily jump around the page.  The “Videos” section is using <a href="http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/" target="blank">fancybox.js</a> to modalize and play the embedded iframe. Lastly, this is 100% a static HTML page that I built using the static site generator <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> (same as what I used to build this site), but still have server side capabilities with the contact form thanks to <a href="http://formspree.io/" target="_blank">Formspree.io</a>.</p>
