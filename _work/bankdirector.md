As a Front-End Designer, I've have the opportunity to work on many new projects to improve the look and usability of the site. I've been a key player in adding new sections to the site as well as adding new functionality including reimagined event agenda and sponsor pages, adding a reader polling feature + an automatically updating grid of videos just to name a few.
