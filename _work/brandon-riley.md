This is a webpage I built for a friend of mine. It’s a fairly straight-forward webpage with a few features to keep things interesting. I built a parallaxing effect on the header section of the page along with a sticky naviagation that locks to the top of the window when scrolling down to allow users to quickly and easily jump around the page. The “Videos” section is using [fancybox.js][1] to modalize and play the embedded iframe. Lastly, this is 100% a static HTML page that I built using the static site generator [Jekyll][2] (same as what I used to build this site), but still have server side capabilities with the contact form thanks to [Formspree.io][3].
